Use it to deal a hefty amount of damage to other mercenaries without them knowing you’re there.\n\nThe Invisiwatch:\nUse this device to turn yourself entirely invisible, unlike normal invisibility your items and armor become invisible.\n\nThe Spy’s suit:\nWear the spy’s suit to adopt his sounds from Team Fortress 2.\n\nTODO:\nIn the future I aim to add disguising and the electro sapper",
